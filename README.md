## CO-REFERENCING
When more parts of the text refer to the same entity, the multiple occurences are said to Co-reference each other
Simple Co-referencing types are Anapora , Catapora, Split antecedents and Coreferring noun phrases
### Anapora
When pronouns/noun-phrases follow their antecedent (nouns/noun-phrases) the referencing is called Anapora
    E.g. Mathew is a brilliant student. He always comes first in class.
          Here ''He' trails 'Mathew'
### Catapora
When pronouns/noun-phrases lead their antecedent (nouns/noun-phrases) the referencing is called Catapora
    E.g. If she does not study, Gloria will fail her tests.
        Here 'she' leads 'Gloria'
